Code Design for Dependable Systems, Fujiwara Eiji (EN),"Theoretical and practical tools to master matrix code design strategy and technique Error correcting and detecting codes are essential to improving system reliability and have popularly been applied to computer systems and communication systems. Coding theory has been studied mainly using the code generator polynomials; hence, the codes are sometimes called polynomial codes. On the other hand, the codes designed by parity check matrices are referred to in this book as matrix codes. This timely book focuses on the design theory for matrix codes and their practical applications for the improvement of system reliability. As the author effectively demonstrates, matrix codes are far more flexible than polynomial codes, as they are capable of expressing various types of code functions. In contrast to other coding theory publications, this one does not burden its readers with unnecessary polynomial algebra, but rather focuses on the essentials needed to understand and take full advantage of matrix code constructions and designs. Readers are presented with a full array of theoretical and practical tools to master the fine points of matrix code design strategy and technique: * Code designs are presented in relation to practical applications, such as high-speed semiconductor memories, mass memories of disks and tapes, logic circuits and systems, data entry systems, and distributed storage systems * New classes of matrix codes, such as error locating codes, spotty byte error control codes, and unequal error control codes, are introduced along with their applications * A new parallel decoding algorithm of the burst error control codes is demonstrated In addition to the treatment of matrix codes, the author provides readers with a general overview of the latest developments and advances in the field of code design. Examples, figures, and exercises are fully provided in each chapter to illustrate concepts and engage the reader in designing actual code and solving real problems. The matrix codes presented with practical parameter settings will be very useful for practicing engineers and researchers. References lead to additional material so readers can explore advanced topics in depth. Engineers, researchers, and designers involved in dependable system design and code design research will find the unique focus and perspective of this practical guide and reference helpful in finding solutions to many key industry problems. It also can serve as a coursebook for graduate and advanced undergraduate students.", Иностранная литература,0

Following an introduction, the author sets forth the fundamental information and tools needed by researchers and practitioners working in the financial and insurance industries: * Overview of Probability Theory * Discrete-Time stochastic processes * Continuous-time stochastic processes * Stochastic calculus: basic topics The final two chapters, Stochastic Calculus: Advanced Topics and Applications in Insurance, are devoted to more advanced topics. Readers learn the Feynman-Kac formula, the Girsanov's theorem, and complex barrier hitting times distributions. Finally, readers discover how stochastic analysis and principles are applied in practice through two insurance examples: valuation of equity-linked annuities under a stochastic interest rate environment and calculation of reserves for universal life insurance. Throughout the text, figures and tables are used to help simplify complex theory and pro-cesses. An extensive bibliography opens up additional avenues of research to specialized topics.

Neuroscience of Cognitive Development, Nelson Charles A. (EN),"A new understanding of cognitive development from the perspective of neuroscience This book provides a state-of-the-art understanding of the neural bases of cognitive development. Although the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience is still in its infancy, the authors effectively demonstrate that our understanding of cognitive development is and will be vastly improved as the mechanisms underlying development are elucidated. The authors begin by establishing the value of considering neuroscience in order to understand child development and then provide an overview of brain development. They include a critical discussion of experience-dependent changes in the brain. The authors explore whether the mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity differ from those underlying adult plasticity, and more fundamentally, what distinguishes plasticity from development. Having armed the reader with key neuroscience basics, the book begins its examination of the neural bases of cognitive development by examining the methods employed by professionals in developmental cognitive neuroscience. Following a brief historical overview, the authors discuss behavioral, anatomic, metabolic, and electrophysiological methods. Finally, the book explores specific content areas, focusing on those areas where there is a significant body of knowledge on the neural underpinnings of cognitive development, including: * Declarative and non-declarative memory and learning * Spatial cognition * Object recognition * Social cognition * Speech and language development * Attention development For cognitive and developmental psychologists, as well as students in developmental psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive development, the authors' view of behavioral development from the perspective of neuroscience sheds new light on the mechanisms that underlie how the brain functions and how a child learns and behaves.", Иностранная литература,0
